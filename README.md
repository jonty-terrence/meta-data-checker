# Meta Data Checker 

## Description 

The Meta Data Checker is a place to write optimised meta titles and descriptions. Displaying entered information in the same way a user may see it in Google's search results pages, it allows for testing and visualising the appearance of web pages. 

The Meta Data Checker also measures character counts, so that tags remain within Google's specifications.

This project is currently a work in progress and will soon allow users to save their input data and download it as a CSV file for practical use on SEO tasks.
